# Autonomous Network Of Modelled Lifeforms and Yoked-Organisms
The Autonomous Network Of Modelled Lifeforms and Yoked-Organisms (ANOMALY) is a research project focused on developing a simulation of an ecosystem using Unity 3D and Python. The project aims to create a self-sustaining virtual environment in which different lifeforms and organisms interact with each other and their environment.

# Purpose
The purpose of ANOMALY is to provide a tool for studying the interactions and dynamics of ecosystems. By creating a virtual environment, researchers can observe and analyze the behavior and relationships of different lifeforms and organisms without the need for physical experimentation. ANOMALY can also be used to test hypotheses, explore hypothetical scenarios, and inform conservation efforts.

# How It Works
ANOMALY is built on Unity 3D, a powerful game engine that allows for the creation of highly realistic 3D environments. The ecosystem is populated by different lifeforms and organisms, each with their own characteristics and behaviors. Python scripts are used to simulate the behavior of these lifeforms and organisms, including their movements, interactions, and responses to environmental stimuli.

The ecosystem is designed to be self-sustaining, with each organism fulfilling its own needs while also contributing to the larger ecosystem. The environment includes features such as weather patterns, day and night cycles, and various types of terrain to provide a realistic and varied ecosystem for the lifeforms and organisms.

# Getting Started
To get started with ANOMALY, first, clone or download the repository. Then, install Unity 3D and Python if you haven't already. Open the Unity project and start exploring the ecosystem. You can modify the behavior of the lifeforms and organisms by editing the Python scripts.

# Contributing
ANOMALY is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
